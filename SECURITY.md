# Security Policy — HodlHunt

This document describes how to report security vulnerabilities for HodlHunt.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** and **do not** open public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities.

- **Email (preferred)**: `hodlhunt_security@proton.me`
- **Telegram**: `https://t.me/c/3666534515/10`

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impacted component(s)
- Steps to reproduce and a minimal proof-of-concept if possible
- The program ID / cluster (mainnet/devnet) and transaction signatures (if relevant)
- Your recommended fix or mitigation (if you have one)

## Response Targets

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**
- Provide a status update within **7 business days**

Timelines may vary depending on severity and complexity.

## Scope

In scope (examples):

- On-chain program logic (Solana program)
- Critical issues in deployment/configuration that can lead to loss of funds

Out of scope (examples):

- Issues requiring compromised user devices or social engineering
- Denial-of-service that does not lead to loss of funds (case-by-case)
- Reports without a reproducible path

## Safe Harbor

If you make a good-faith effort to follow this policy, avoid privacy violations, and do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate impact, we will not pursue legal action against you for your research.

## Bug Bounty

At the moment, we do not publish a fixed bug bounty schedule. We may offer discretionary rewards depending on impact and quality of the report.
